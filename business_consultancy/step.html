<h2>Steps towards Sustainability</h2>

<h4>
1. It’s very unlikely that all SDGs will be met, but we shouldn’t lose faith
For starters, member states avoided actual quantified benchmarks for 2030 for many of the targets, which means we will never definitively be able to assess whether they have been met or not! On the other hand, that they won’t all be met does not make them pointless. Their strength is that there is something for many different actors across multiple constituencies to work towards collectively – no bad thing in an increasingly polarised world where multilateralism is badly creaking. No other multilateral framework can claim to have such broad global ownership, thanks in part to the extensive consultation phase. If they become a common reference point then they can be something that unites. And if we want to make progress on the many issues they cover, this is going to have to be a starting point.

2. The SDGs need to be seen as a springboard, not an end in themselves
The SDGs are words on paper that need energy, evidence, and political will to become actions at the local and national levels that will enable people and the planet to thrive. If this agenda is to truly be transformative, we can’t be bound only by what is measurable in 2015. It is important to keep focus on those who benefit from the SDGs the most: the children, the poor, and the marginalised. There is a genuine risk that the SDGs become all about the indicators, rather than about action towards realising the larger vision. Unless these indicators are used to significantly improve their lives and opportunities, we will have failed in this ambitious agenda.

3. We need to dramatically change the existing rules of our global economy
Overall, I place very little hope in the SDGs. To me, the big problem is that they place indefinite GDP growth at the very centre of their poverty-reduction strategy. But we know that growth is not going to get us there. In fact, in order to growth the global economy enough to eradicate poverty (with existing income distributions), we will cause massive and irreversible climate change. With our present economic model, it is not possible to eradicate poverty. But there’s a flicker of hope. The SDGs have made a commitment to eradicate poverty. We can leverage this to point out that the only hope for doing this is to dramatically change the existing rules of our global economy to make it fundamentally fairer for the world’s majority. That means completely reorganising the existing distribution of wealth. My point is that we might be able to achieve radical change by calling for the fulfilment of a not-very-radical goal.

4. Those working on economic development and human rights should work together
As we argued here, we believe that development is ultimately about enhancing the rights and freedoms of poor people everywhere. It’s essential that those working on economic development and human rights work together to enhance our joint efforts. Governments should be held to account nationally and internationally for commitments to promote development and development actors (donors, NGOs and others) should explicitly use the language of rights in their advocacy and programmes.

5. Companies now face the challenge of contributing to the development agenda
The process to develop the SDGs has been more consultative than any other UN process in history. And as a result, we have both a comprehensive and in some ways a compromise vision of the world we want – reflective of many sectors and voices, including the voice of business. The opportunity now for companies is to carve out their unique contribution to what is a very big agenda. Determining how to navigate that will be an interesting challenge and is certainly what’s filling my days at the moment.

6. The SDGs can be a driver of climate action
<br>
The increasing impacts of climate change will be a huge challenge to achieving the SDGs, perhaps the biggest challenge. But we must also recognise that Agenda 2030 includes climate change as a development issue for the first time in an international development document. This is huge! As we think around implementation, governments and experts must see the SDGs as a huge driver of climate action towards a low-carbon future and a way to increase adaptive capacities. If governments make sure that investments in areas such as energy, agriculture, transport, infrastructure, forestry, water are climate-friendly and don’t lock-in polluting technologies we would make huge progress towards limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees.
