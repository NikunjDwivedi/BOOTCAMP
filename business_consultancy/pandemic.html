<h2>Pandemic's effect on trade</h2>
<h4>
The year 2020 was marked by some of the largest reductions in trade and output volumes since World War II. The declines in both world industrial production and goods trade in the first half of 2020 were of similar depth to those at the trough of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Nevertheless, they materialised and disappeared more quickly, facilitating a V-shaped recovery in 2020. Trade continued to grow strongly in 2021 and has compensated some, but not all, of the accumulated losses from the steep declines seen earlier.1

Initial pandemic-era expectations for a double-digit decline in world merchandise trade in 2020 did not materialise. The volume of global trade has recovered to the pre-pandemic level at an extraordinarily fast pace from around mid-2020

However, the relatively positive performance of aggregate trade hides considerable differences across products, economic sectors and trading relationships. The trade collapse of early 2020 did not hit all products to the same extent and the rising tide did not lift all parts of the global trade system equally either. Trade impacts across specific goods, services and trade partners show a highly diverse picture and created pressures on specific sectors and supply chains that were much more pronounced than during the GFC.

In 2020, trade in services declined more and has been recovering at a slower pace than goods trade. Not surprisingly, trade in travel and tourism services slumped dramatically but trade in digitally delivered services, such as telecommunication and information technology services, boomed. Overall, the value of exports of services in OECD countries declined in 2020 by -16.7%, twice as much as the value of goods exports, which dropped by -8.2%. This was also one factor underpinning the comparatively large adjustments in output relative to those in trade, as services account for a larger share of the economy than their weight in international trade

Trade in several types of goods and services plummeted, while trade in others increased markedly. The product structure of merchandise trade changed significantly: trade in several products nosedived (e.g. fuels, aircrafts, cars, mechanical machinery, steel), while trade in some other products increased (e.g. protective equipment and pharmaceutical products, food, and ‘home nesting’ products such as domestic appliances and electronics) (Figure 3).

Our analysis of the data shows that the variation in trade impacts across the different product categories in 2020 was not only larger than during the GFC, but also larger than in any other year in the past two decades. The changes in the trade structure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in a single year was of a similar magnitude to changes otherwise typically seen over 4-5 years.
